A Standard Linked List has a final node that points to NULL, marking a clear finish; a Circular Linked List has its last node point back to the first node (the head), creating a continuous loop. For efficiency, both lists can search in O(n) time. However, for inserting or deleting at the end of a standard list or the head of a circular list, operations can slow down to O(n). By adding a tail pointer (a separate pointer to the last node), these worst-case operations instantly become O(1) (constant time), making the circular list particularly efficient for quick access to both the start and end of the sequence.
